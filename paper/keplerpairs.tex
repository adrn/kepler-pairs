% aims & context
The 200,000 stars targeted by the \kepler mission for intensive observation of transiting exoplanets are the most extensive and well-studied sample of exoplanet hosts. Despite their importance to exoplanet studies, these stars are generally not as precisely characterized as the nearby, brighter stars targeted by other planet-hunting missions. In particular, while a number of wide, individually resolvable binary systems with planets around one or both stars are known from radial velocity surveys, none have been identified from \kepler due to the lack of kinematic data on these stars. Such systems would be powerful tools for the study of planet formation and evolution, as differences in the compositions of the two stars may correspond to differences in their planetary systems. 
%Wide binaries composed of stars with known exoplanets are a valuable observational probe of planet formation and evolution, as differences in the compositions of the two stars may correspond to differences in their planetary systems. Currently all known planet-hosting binaries with sufficient angular separation for individually resolved observations come from radial velocity surveys, and the sample is limited in number. 
% methods
With the second data release of \gaia, parallax and proper motion measurements have become available for \todo{over XX\%} of the \kepler sample. 
% results
Using these data, we identify \todo{X} pairs of co-moving stars where both members are among the main \kepler sample. Of these, \todo{X} pairs contain at least one star with known planets, and \todo{X} have planets around both stars. 
We analyze the likelihood of these co-moving pairs having been binaries from birth using chemical abundances from \citet{brewer18}. % maybe test for Tc trends or something but we'll leave very detailed analysis on planet-star connections to future work
Finally, we present improved parallax and distance measures for \todo{X} low-mass stars in \kepler using their kinematically associated partners.
